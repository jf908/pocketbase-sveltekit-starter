# Personal PocketBase / SvelteKit Starter App

This is just https://github.com/spinspire/pocketbase-sveltekit-starter with some stuff simplified/edited/updated for my own liking.

Also see https://github.com/jf908/sveltekit-pocketbase-starter which doesn't uses the prebuilt pocketbase binary instead for situations where you do not need to customize the go functionality.
